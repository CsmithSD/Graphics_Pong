Program Description:
The classic arcade game Pong with a few twists.

Compilation Instructions:
>make

The makefile should take care of the rest.

Known Bugs:
The collision detection is still a little buggy. (not a feature)
At very high speeds, the ball can jump through the paddles. (feature?)
At very high speeds, the paddles become more or less uncontrollable. (feature?)

Extra Stuff:
Paddle rotation
Ball speed adjustment -  +,- increase and decrease ball speed
Paddle speed adjustment - *,/ increase and decrease paddle speed
Smooth paddle control (you don't have to repeatedly hit the keys to keep moving)
    You can also move diagonally and move both paddles at the same time
    Theoretically you can move diagonally and rotate at the same time but 
        most keyboards don't allow more than a few keys at a time.
        Fortunately the num-pad and letters seems to be counted separately
Keys ignore caps and num-lock
Numpad control to allow both players a similar key layout
Controls displayed in pause screen
